# Dr. Joy's Portfolio 

NLP:

    Uses Natural Language Processing on Neural Information Processing Papers 
    (over 50,000 files) to evaluate the trendiest topics in Machine Learning research. 

Analyze Baby Name Trends (analyze_baby_name_trends):

    Uses SQL statements within Jupyter notebook 
    to analyze trends in baby names over time. 

Classify YouTube Comments:

    Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier - the YouTube Dataset
    This is a project using Naive Bayes to classify comments from YouTube as spam or not spam (ham)
    Jupyter Notebook/Python: pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, glob
    Sklearn: CountVectorizer, train_test_split (sklearn.model_selection), MultinomialNB (sklearn.naive_bayes), and ConfusionMatrixDisplay, classification_report (sklearn.metrics)

Importance of Handwashing:

    Evaluation of reduction in proportion of deaths after discovery of handwashing.
    Using Pandas, Matplotlib. 
    Datetime, comparison of clinics, bootstrap analysis, confidence intervals

Pet Shelter Analysis:

    Uses Python: pandas, matplotlib to answer the following:
    •	Is there an area where more pets are found (top 5 places)? To help the shelter to coordinate with local volunteers/ animal control in these areas.
    •	What is the average number of pets found in a month in the year 2015? This helps them gather enough resources and donations to care for the animals they receive.
    •	What is the ratio of incoming pets vs. adopted pets? 
    •	What is the distribution of the types of animals in the shelter? 
    •	What are the adoption rates for specific breeds? Find the top 5 dog breeds in the shelter (based on count) and then find the adoption percentage of each breed.
    •	What are the adoption rates for different colorings? Find the top 5 colorings in the shelter (based on count) and then find the adoption percentage of each color.
    •	About how many animals are spayed/neutered each month?

Video Game Sales Visualization (graph_video_game_sales):

    Using Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
    Visualize trends in sales across continents, years, and categories to answer questions about data. 
    •	Regional Sales by Publisher and Region as a stacked column graph 
    •	Global Sales by Year as a line graph
    •	Global Sales Distribution for Action Games as a histogram 
    •	North American Sales by Genre as a pie chart 
    •	European Sales by Genre as a pie chart 
    •	Count of Games by Platform
